## Task Progress Log

### 1 â€“ Setup Project Repository and Structure

**Date:** 2025-07-06 17:20:00  
**Decisions:**

- Implemented TypeScript project structure with Rollup bundler
- Configured ESLint with Prettier integration for code quality
- Set up Jest testing framework with coverage reporting
- Added development workflow tools (lint-staged, husky)
- Enhanced package.json description with comprehensive feature list
- Created development checklist and documentation structure
- Fixed ESLint configuration (renamed to .mjs for ES modules support)

**Status:** Completed

### 2 â€“ Implement Swagger Spec Loader

**Date:** 2025-07-06 20:40:00  
**Decisions:**

- Implemented SwaggerLoader class with caching mechanism and validation
- Added Logger utility class using Winston for structured logging
- Used @apidevtools/swagger-parser for robust OpenAPI spec parsing
- Comprehensive testing strategy: 16 unit tests + 7 integration tests
- Achieved 94% test coverage with proper mocking and error handling
- Enhanced TypeScript path mapping with @ prefix for cleaner imports
- **SIMPLIFIED PROJECT:** Removed Rollup bundling (not needed for npx consumption)
  - Removed build scripts and dependencies
  - Project now focuses purely on development and testing
  - Simplified package.json configuration
  - Maintained full path mapping functionality with @ imports

**Improvements:**

- Clean import syntax: `import { Logger } from '@/logging/Logger'`
- TypeScript path mappings: `@/core/*`, `@/utils/*`, `@/types/*`, etc.
- Jest moduleNameMapper configured for seamless testing
- Simplified development workflow without build complexity

**Technical Decisions:**

- SwaggerLoader uses axios for HTTP requests with robust error handling
- Winston logger with structured JSON output and configurable log levels
- Comprehensive test coverage including real API integration tests
- Path mappings resolve correctly in development, testing, and IDE

**Status:** Completed
