## Task Progress Log

### 1 â€“ Setup Project Repository and Structure

**Date:** 2025-07-06 17:20:00  
**Decisions:**

- Implemented TypeScript project structure with Rollup bundler
- Configured ESLint with Prettier integration for code quality
- Set up Jest testing framework with coverage reporting
- Added development workflow tools (lint-staged, husky)
- Enhanced package.json description with comprehensive feature list
- Created development checklist and documentation structure
- Fixed ESLint configuration (renamed to .mjs for ES modules support)

**Status:** Completed

### 2 â€“ Implement Swagger Spec Loader

**Date:** 2025-07-06 20:40:00  
**Decisions:**

- Implemented SwaggerLoader class with caching mechanism and validation
- Added Logger utility class using Winston for structured logging
- Used @apidevtools/swagger-parser for robust spec validation
- Created comprehensive unit tests (16 tests) and integration tests (7 tests)
- Fixed TypeScript configuration issues and resolved import path mappings
- **Enhancement:** Configured TypeScript path mapping with @ prefix for cleaner imports
- **Enhancement:** Simplified project by removing Rollup build system (npx consumption only)
- **Enhancement:** Fixed ts-node with tsconfig-paths for proper path mapping in dev mode
- **SIMPLIFIED PROJECT:** Removed Rollup bundling (not needed for npx consumption)
  - Removed build scripts and dependencies
  - Project now focuses purely on development and testing
  - Simplified package.json configuration
  - Maintained full path mapping functionality with @ imports

**Improvements:**

- Clean import syntax: `import { Logger } from '@/logging/Logger'`
- TypeScript path mappings: `@/core/*`, `@/utils/*`, `@/types/*`, etc.
- Jest moduleNameMapper configured for seamless testing
- Simplified development workflow without build complexity

**Technical Decisions:**

- SwaggerLoader uses axios for HTTP requests with robust error handling
- Winston logger with structured JSON output and configurable log levels
- Comprehensive test coverage including real API integration tests
- Path mappings resolve correctly in development, testing, and IDE

**Coverage:** 94% test coverage  
**Status:** Completed

### 3 â€“ Implement Logging System

**Date:** 2025-07-06 20:40:00  
**Decisions:**

- Already implemented in Task 2 as part of SwaggerLoader dependency
- Logger class provides structured logging with configurable levels
- Integrated with Winston for professional logging capabilities

**Status:** Completed

### 4 â€“ Implement Authentication System

**Date:** 2025-07-06 21:16:00  
**Decisions:**

- Implemented Authentication class with comprehensive API key management
- Features include: API key validation, testing, masking, and header generation
- Removed direct process.env access to avoid linting issues (configurable via constructor)
- Created 20 comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality
- Added proper error handling for network failures and authentication errors
- Implemented secure API key masking for logging purposes
- Added flexible header name configuration
- Included placeholder for future OAuth 2.0 implementation

**Key Methods:**

- `setApiKey()` / `clearApiKey()` - API key management
- `getAuthHeaders()` - Generate headers for API requests
- `validateApiKey()` - Format validation with regex
- `testApiKey()` - Live API validation
- `getMaskedApiKey()` - Secure logging support

**Coverage:** 100% test coverage for Authentication class  
**Total Coverage:** 98.26% statements, 85.71% branch, 95.45% functions
